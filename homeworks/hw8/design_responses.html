					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>This article gave me insight into the many various types of Dark Patterns that there are in design. I did not know that the evolution of these patterns had gotten so thourough and intense for users. However, upon reading, I now know the many techniques that one can use to decieve their user.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p>My favorite part of this article was reading about the different ways in which one can be tricked so that everyone can avoid it. One was about disguised ads, which I have seen too often in social media, and even in video advertisements. I think this was my favorite part because the author went into detail with each one so a user can avoid these dark patterns at all costs.</p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p>"The algorithm is designed to serve new stories, both true and false, to users depending on their observed opinion. That level of personalization forms a confirmation bias and ends up narrowing an already self-curated perspective, which restricts the readersâ€™ ability to organically broaden their knowledge."</p>
					</li>
