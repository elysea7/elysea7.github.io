<h1>Elyse Austin</h1>
<em>English Year 3</em>
<p>Hey! My name is Elyse and I am (unfortunately) from Huntington Beach, California. I love to go to different cafes, especially to read or do work, running, cats, and spending time with my friends. As an English major, I read a lot and one of my goals is to read 25 books this year. I am really exicted about this decal because I really want to broaden my skills and hopefully create a super cool blog!</p>

    <li>Something I learned in this article is to pay close attention as to how a design catches your eye and keeps you invested. For example, Airbnb puts a location within the search bar in order to peak your interest and increase your likelihood of traveling and booking a place.</li>
    <li>My favorite part about this artcile was learning how to look closely at deign techniques and how certain hooks you in. In fact, the very design of how they lay out the app caught my eye as the animation kept rolling.</li>
    <li>"The placeholder text in the search bar could have just said “Search here” but instead they mention a specific city. Though I have no intention of going to London, seeing the possibility of it is exciting."</li>
