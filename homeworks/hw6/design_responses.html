						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned in this article that spacing and size is very important when it comes to animation choices. One has to think about how long the animation should run and how it will please the user's eye. Additionally, I learned that there is a lot more than simple integrations, like easing into fuctions and blurring effects that make animations much nicer to view.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of this artcile was showing the side-by-side of good vs bad animations. I felt like this helped me visualize how these animations work and helped me think why it is more appropiate as a design. I also liked how they provided descriptions as to why these choices were good vs bad.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p>"So, if we sum up all of the above-mentioned rules and principles, the animation in the interface should reflect the movements that we know from the physical world â€” friction, acceleration, etc. Imitating the behavior of objects from the real world we can create a sequence that allows users to understand what to expect from the interface." This quote summed up the artcile in a pleasing way and helped me understand it in a much more interesting way. </p>
