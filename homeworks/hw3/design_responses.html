							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>I learned that fonts are one of the most important aspects when it comes to designing a website. In order to capture an aduience's attetion, you have to have fonts that reflect the style of your website and the message you want it to convey to them, since this is the first thing that they are looking at. I also learned that pairing your fonts with the illustrations of your website contributes to the asethic in an important way as it helps meld the design together into cohension. Lastly, I learned that there is a golden ration when it comes to scaling your font and that there is the Modular Scale to help generate precise font sizes.</p>

							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p>My favorite part of this artcle was learning about how different font sizes are crucial to your audeince. I particular like the section where it describes how there are some fonts that are more appropriate for children because certain fonts are more legible for them to read. I found this interesting because I did not know this played such an important role in one's website, though upon reflecting, I realized that type also plays an important role in whether I am attracted to a website or not.   </p>
