                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>Something I learned from this artcile is that there are many different designs to be incorporated into a website in order to make it appealing to the audience it is projected to. The transitions are really important to keep the app pleasing to the eye and want the user wanting to keep using your app/website. Additionally, I learned that animation syles move in a way that human usually like to look (like left to right) and this helps the experience of using the app/website.</p>

                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>My favorite part of this artcile was being able to scroll through many different designs and see which ones work for me and which don't. I liked that there were many different options and they all had different ideas in order to show the user that there are a lot of options when it comes to design. This really made the artcile trustworthy and not biases toward any one type of design.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p>One inspiration that was my favorite was the Travel Map. I really liked the animation style and the popping graphics associated with clicking. This achieved their goal because it made sense within their design choices and pleased my eyes to keep me looking at the interface. Another inspiration I liked was the create a new message because the animation style and layout made sense and used techinques that pleased the human mind.</p>
