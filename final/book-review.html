            <h3>P.S. I Love You: Maybe Grief Can Be Funny</h3>
            <div class="container">
                <p>...In Cecelia Ahern’s novel P.S. I Love You, readers are
                    taken on a journey of Holly’s (the main protagonist) grief.
                    Leaving one note each month of the year before his death,
                    her husband (Gerry), is with her every step of the way.
                    This novel is long, but super fast. I kept wanting to turn 
                    the page despite how frustrated I would become. Rather
                    that be because of character flaws, or lousy plot points, the
                    core of this novel is supremely entertaining and is a great,
                    quick read when you can’t seem to focus. It’s easy to follow
                    and easy to get lost in.
